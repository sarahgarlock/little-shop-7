## Description

"Little Esty Shop" is a group project that requires students to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices.

## Details
- In this project, we were able to design a database schema and define the relationships between models. 
- Advanced routing techniques were utilized including namespacing to organize and group like functionality together.
- Advanced active record techniques were also used to perform complex database queries.
- Students accessed a public API while utilizing POROs as a way to apply OOP principles to organize code.

## Requirements
- This project uses Rails 7.0.x, Ruby 3.1.1, and PostgreSQL

## Future work
-  Future work on this project could include: 
  - Additional visual design elements to make the app look more similar to the wireframes.
